A set of gravity simulators.

Mainly because I enjoyed writing them
and I like the maths around it.

Note that these 2D demos use the 3D Newtonian (classical) gravity mechanics model
and not the 2D version.

INSTRUCTIONS
(1)
Click on the screen and balls will bounce with a certain restitution, and will eventually just bounce down at the bottom of the screen.

(2)
Click on the screen for balls that will gravitationally orbit a point a little lower than the screen.

(3)
Left click to create a planet with little gravity. Middle click for a high-gravity star.
Planets will orbit stars, stars in this version remain static.
The whole thing might be more visible if you zoom your browser page out.

Made by me, Dan Dart.
Do what you want with this, apart from getting me in trouble for it killing your CPU.
